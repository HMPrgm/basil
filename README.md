# Basil
An open-source, self-hostable personal finance tracker to take control of your financial data. Built for those who miss Mint.com.
## The End of an Era, The Start of a New One
In late 2023, Intuit announced the shutdown of Mint.com, a beloved personal finance app that helped millions of users manage their money for over a decade. Many of us relied on Mint for its simple interface and powerful aggregation features.

I've always wanted to create a platform similar to Mint, and so Basil was born. This project aims to replicate the core functionality of Mint while being completely open-source.
## Key Features
- Unified Dashboard: See all your financial accounts in one place.
- Account Aggregation: Securely connect to thousands of financial institutions using the Plaid API.
- Transaction Categorization: Automatically categorize your spending to see where your money goes. Manually re-categorize as needed.
- Spending Trends: Visualize your income and expenses over time with insightful charts and graphs.
- Budgeting Tools: Create custom budgets for different categories (e.g., Groceries, Dining Out) and track your progress.
- Financial Goals: Set and track savings goals for things like a down payment, a new car, or an emergency fund.
- Custom Alerts: Get notified about large transactions, upcoming bills, or when you're nearing a budget limit.
